You'll regret that...

I shall not yield...

I will wipe them out!",,"Light Hit Taken
Feeble!","Heavy Hit Taken

That was discombobulating...

This is no job for a detective...",,"Light Hit Taken
You don't want to do this.","Heavy Hit Taken
Ugh, we got a situation!","Fallen
The truth... will come out...

From detective... to victim...

I've been... outsmarted...","Joining Party

Winging it wasn't the best idea...

I didn't factor this in...",,"Light Hit Taken
Gutsy.","Heavy Hit Taken
No...","Fallen
What are... the odds?
