Henceforth, you will be my guard. Worry not. Should any danger arise, I shall dispose of it.,Chat: Idleness, ,Inactivity serves no purpose whatsoever. Hmph.,Chat: The Mortal World, ,The world remains constant over the centuries. But human life is like the dew at dawn or a bubble rising through water. Transitory.,Chat: Worldly Beauty, ,All the world holds dear is but a backdrop of constant motion. I stand before it alone and unchanging.,When It Rains, ,Rainfall alone does not constitute a storm. Thunder is required.,When It Snows, ,The Winter Shogun approaches.,On a Clear Day, ,Clear skies can do nothing to hide the brilliance of lightning.

This is why reaching Eternity is desirable. ...Actually, this is why reaching Eternity is necessary.,About the Raiden Shogun: Eternity, , is a terrible thing. This body's purpose is to withstand wear and tear, that the one within might achieve Eternity.,About Us: Okuzumeshuu, ,I declare you my chamberlain. In other words, according to my judgment, you are useful to the Shogunate and loyal to me.,Something to Share, ,No, I have nothing to share with you at this time. But you... You use elemental energy without the aid of a Vision. How is this possible? Please enlighten me.,Interesting Things, ,Her body may have perished, but she became the Sacred Sakura. This, too, is a form of Eternity.,About , ,Kamisato... One of the most distinguished clans in all of Inazuma. Despite Ayato's trickery in regard to the Tri-Commission's affairs, he is nevertheless a loyal subject. His past misdeeds shall be excused.,About , ,A loyal and righteous subject, and an accomplished warrior. She is worthy to be called a hero. With an heir of such great promise, the future prosperity of the Kujou Clan is assured.,About , ,Indeed. It was I who slew ,. But I also allowed the people of Sangonomiya to continue worshiping it as the Watatsumi Omikami, so that it might enjoy their offerings. Now, Sangonomiya has destroyed the local Narukami Shrine and rebels against the Shogunate. As the Divine Priestess representing the Watatsumi Omikami, she must be held accountable.,About , ,Who?,About , ,Who? Ah, the firework maker. A manufacturer of fleeting illusions, enamored with the realm of fantasy and imagination, but a subject of mine nonetheless.,Hmm? Fireworks were released on Tenryou Commission property? By whom... her?,More About the Raiden Shogun: I, ,State your query. To the point.,More About the Raiden Shogun: II, ,On stormy days, the people of Inazuma chant \"kuwabara, kuwabara,\" believing that this will protect themselves from being struck by lightning. You need not worry about any storm summoned by my own hand — they will bring you no harm.

I will read out a speech for you in front of all my attendants. \"Embarrassing\"? ...Understood.,Feelings About Ascension: Intro, ,The initial stage of my journey, or Shoden, involves learning the nine-way sword slash and the foundations of the art of the polearm.

Or rather, it is the other traditions that do not differ from mine.,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up, ,At the intermediate stage of my journey, or Chuden, the art of the sword focuses on the study of various stances and transitions. The art of the polearm — slashes and backslashes.,Feelings About Ascension: Climax, ,The final stage of my journey, or Kaiden, is the study of the most profound techniques. Unavoidably, these draw heavily on elemental power, rendering them beyond the capabilities of most mortals. Most practitioners of other traditions are unable to ever reach this level.,When Thunder Strikes, ,Dear me, that didn't frighten you, did it? After all, you are in the presence of the most supreme and terrifying incarnation of lightning in the whole of Teyvat.,Good Afternoon, ,Time for dessert. What? Why not?

Are you a tengu warrior?,About Us: Protector, ,Despite serving as my guard during this journey, you need not shield me from danger.

Since then, they have branched out and blossomed into a variety of techniques according to each master's individual aptitude.,What would you say to another sparring session? If you emerge unscathed again, I'll let you found your own martial arts tradition in Inazuma. Ah, the drive to advance and evolve in the martial arts is truly unstoppable.,About the , ,Really? So in all this time, no new Electro Visions have appeared in the outside world? Well, what I can say on this topic is subject to certain constraints, but... it is not by my will that Visions are granted or denied. The key is people's desire, and... well, there's another side to it too.,About , ,Ah, that girl... She used to be the kind of person who could easily be swayed with some Fried Tofu. It's a relief to see how shrewd and resourceful she's now become. Still, I have to admit that I was a little upset to become the target of her scheming myself. I know it was for my own good, but I'm afraid she will mock me next time we meet... Perhaps I should take the initiative and strike her first? Hmm, she'll dodge it anyway.,About , ,Kamisato... One of the most distinguished clans in all of Inazuma. Eh? That's exactly what the Shogun said? Well, A—Ayaka's also well-versed in the art of the sword.,About , ,I can't deny that I am somewhat culpable in the events that led to him being almost stripped of his Vision, but I rather think the Shogun should be the one to extend a formal apology to him...

Also, he sure can drink a lot.,About , ,I admire her humility; it is a sign of true wisdom. With the power she holds, Buer is capable of doing many things beyond our wildest imaginations... and yet, she uses her power only to right wrongs and to protect. She is a truly gentle god.,More About Ei: III, ,The account given in the book \",\" is largely an accurate one. At that time, she was preoccupied with various domestic matters within the island, so as her kagemusha, I assumed her identity and joined the troops dispatched to pacify Watatsumi. After this point, however, the story turns into mere wishful thinking. Back then, I was just a martial artist wrapped up in all the fighting, not a social reformer or moral leader.,More About Ei: IV, ,Perhaps my pursuit of Eternity is nothing more than a form of escapism. In the end, the path I took was like that of a turtle who hides in its shell. Still, turtles have always been a symbol of longevity. Perhaps in order to reach Eternity, one has to follow their example.,More About Ei: V, ,I'm fearful because of what I witnessed , — , demise and that thing. But, if...
